<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>Here are some FAQs we have been asked. This should help understand the process and how we work.</h2>
<div class="">
  <ul>

    <li class="question">
      Does Credit Repair / Cleansing actually work?
    </li>

<p>
  - Yes it does! If you want a better understanding research the FCRA and the FDCPA. Anything that can be put on your reports, can come off. Nobody is Legally forced to put anything on your reports. But if they do all accounts reporting have to be 100% Verifiable, Timely and Accurate. Alot of times the accounts don't match all 3 amongst all 3 Bureaus
</p>

<li class="question">
  Can you really go from bad Credit to Good Credit so fast?
</li>

<p>
  - Yes you can! Everyone is different and every Credit Report situation is different. Some can jump higher in points then others faster. It varies all by whats on your reports.

</p>

<li class="question">
  How fast have you seen someone go from Bad to the 700 club?
</li>

<p>
  - Normally for us we have seen people with horrible scores get into the 700 club around the 3-4 months mark of consistent disputing and working on their Credit. We have seen some
 Clients recently go from the 400s-700s in less then a month. Everyone is different, that will definitely not always be the case.
</p>

<li class="question">
  Do you really not need our SSN?
</li>

<p>
  - Nope when working with us, we do not need your SSN and it's not on your reports. We only need your reports themselves. Once we email you back the letters and documents after we're done, THEN you yourself add your SSN to the paperwork before mailing off. Keeps us from every seeing it

</p>

<li class="question">
  Why are yal so affordable and everyone is so expensive $$$
</li>

<p>
  - Answered this a thousand times, simply were not greedy. Most other companies don't know about how Credit Repair works, so these other repair companies like to take advantage of them. Simple as that.

</p>

<li class="question">
  How are you guys different...

</li>

<p>
  - I'm pretty sure there are other companies out there like us with an honest mission of helping others. You just got lucky and found us üôÇ But we're transparent and let you know what's going on every step of the way. Plus having your life be controlled by those 3 digits (Credit Score) is stupid to us, so we want the credit of being the ones who beat the system. üëç
</p>

<li class="question">
  So the only work your clients have to do working with you is just mail the letters out?
</li>

<p>
  - Correct! All you have to do is get the letters notorized, signed and just mail them out CERTIFIED!
</p>

<li class="question">
  Why Certified??

</li>

<p>
  - This way it is confirmed that someone at the Bureaus has physically received your letters and can't lie and say they haven't. Which they will do and continue to do so
</p>

<li class="question">
   I just don't want to be scammed...
</li>

<p>
  - We understand that completely, it's the internet we don't blame you. But we're a good honest company just trying to show people that Repairing your Credit is possible without being taken advantage of by other reputable companies. Plus our posts and blogs give you insight on how to do it yourself if you have the dedication.

</p>

<li class="question">
  Who is this service geared towards?
</li>

<p>
  - We are geared towards the people who are busy living life and can't devote time to fix their Credit even though they want to. These people are in the market for obtaining a home loan, new car or higher limit Credit Cards in the near future!
